        <p class="firstpara">Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans made from seeds of Coffea plant
            species. It is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily
            due to its caffeine content, and is one of the most popular drinks in the world.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="firstpara">From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce unroasted green coffee. The
            seeds are then roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water
            before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced
            coffee is common. </p>
